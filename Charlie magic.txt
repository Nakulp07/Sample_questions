// Charlie has a magic mirror that shows the right-rotated versions of a given word. To generate different right rotations
// of a word, the word is written in a circle in clockwise order and read starting from any given character in clockwise
// order until all the characters are covered. For example, in the word "sample", if we start with 'p', we get the right
// rotated word as "plesam".
// Write an algorithm to output 1 if the word1 is a right rotation of word2 otherwise output -1.
